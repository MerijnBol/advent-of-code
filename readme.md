### Working with my system:

1. source commands.bash
2. create a new puzzle template
`new [year] [day]`
3. fill in test.txt and input.txt
4. run test input 
` run [year] [day] test`
5. run actual input
`run [year] [day]`

### Does not contain actual input files per creators request:

>     [...] please don't go on a quest to collect many or all of the inputs for every puzzle. Doing so makes it that much easier for someone to clone and steal the whole site. I put tons of time and money into Advent of Code, and the many inputs are one way I prevent people from copying the content.
